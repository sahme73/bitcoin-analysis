 **Communication:**
 ---
 **Team Meetings:** The team will be meeting virtually via Discord. The meetings will typically aim to be on Monday nights or early Saturday/Sunday; however, as a team, we are willing to meet throughout the week based on the team's varying personal schedules. The length of each meeting will vary per week but will likely be approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour long. Information from the meetings will be logged within the Discord server chat rooms and important items will be stored on a Google document with time-stamps. The note-taker will rotate each meeting.
 
  **Assistance:** Team communication for help or opinions is going to take place via Discord and iMessage for instant text and voice communication. Teammates should expect a response from other teammates within 24 hours, but preferably the team should respond as soon as possible.

 **Respect:** Firstly, the team will not be tolerating any form of disrespectful behavior toward others. Secondly, the team will work together to approve ideas and will be inclusive to all members in any decision-making process. Thirdly, the team will strive to actively engage with each other and honor any ideas brought forth by one another.

 **Collaboration:**
 ---
  **Work Distribution:** The initial meeting each week should gauge the overall work required as a collective team to be completed each week. Within the meeting, the team will equally split the weekly work and members will decide which portion to be responsible for. If there are loose tasks with no volunteers, the work will be randomly distributed to a member.
 
  **Time Commitment:** Per the work distribution section, equal work is the target for the team. Thus, each member should have no less than 2 hours or a maximum of 6 hours of work per week on the weekly deliverables. If a member is struggling to meet this criterion, the team should effectively work together to alleviate the stress of said member by assisting in lengthy tasks. If a member feels that they are committing too much work per week compared to others, it should be expressed and equalized without elevated conflict.

 **Conflict Resolution:** Hopefully, no major conflicts will arise while working on this project; however, disagreements are likely to occur and need proper resolution. If there are disagreements between individuals on how work should be handled, the team should vote on the proper course of action -- if there is a tie, possibly use randomization (i.e. coin flip) to resolve the issues. If a member fails to meet their required weekly work, they need a proper explanation as to why they fell behind and insight on how to prevent late work for distribution in the next week. Additionally, if there is outstanding misbehavior or lack of communication by any team member, the team should first attempt to handle the situation accordingly, or reach out to our mentor and/or course staff for assistance.
