### Feedback

The team has completed data parsing and DFS along with testing each of those components. However the tests need to be ported to catch2 testing, which they are currently working on. They have the implementation for Dijkstra's in as well but are working through some bugs in their code. They have yet to start implementing the third algorithm, but are on good footing to compelete by the deadline. Overall good job!
