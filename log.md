**Week 1:**
---
- Goals: This week, our goal was to fix the problems our mentor found in our project proposal. We were going to try to utilize the material from this week's lectures to assist in this goal. We have not completed but are near completing it. We plan on resubmitting our proposal tomorrow.
- Tasks Completed: Each member attended lecture and particiapted in group discussion about solving our problems, most notably in data storage. 
- Problems: We did not encounter any notable problems this week.
- Plans: We plan to resubmit the proposal by Monday and spend the rest of the week reading in the csv file into our chosen data structure. Depending on how smoothly that goes, we may try to get started on our traversal algorithm.
