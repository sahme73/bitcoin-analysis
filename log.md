**Week 1:**
---
- Goals: This week, our goal was to fix the problems our mentor found in our project proposal. We were going to try to utilize the material from this week's lectures to assist in this goal. We have not completed but are near completing it. We plan on resubmitting our proposal tomorrow.
- Tasks Completed: Each member attended lecture and particiapted in group discussion about solving our problems, most notably in data storage. 
- Problems: We did not encounter any notable problems this week.
- Plans: We plan to resubmit the proposal by Monday and spend the rest of the week reading in the csv file into our chosen data structure. Depending on how smoothly that goes, we may try to get started on our traversal algorithm.

**Week 2**
---
- Goals: This week our goal was to submit the problem by Monday, prepare the CSV file, and work on the traversal if there was time. We did not reach this goal. Due to slow communication, the proposal still hasn't been approved. We did succeed in creating some basic code for preparing the graph.
- Tasks Completed: This week, we contacted our mentor to make sure our plans were ok with him. We rewrote and resubmitted the project proposal. We completed some basic code to prepare our graph in memory.
- Problems: There were no notable problems this week. In last week's plans, we forgot to account for the delay between submitting to our mentor and his response. Therefore, things took longer than we thought.
- Plans: This week, we will finish setting up the graph in memory and write the DFS traversal. We will also write some simple test cases.
