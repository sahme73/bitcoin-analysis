**Week 1:**
---
- Goals: This week, our goal was to fix the problems our mentor found in our project proposal. We were going to try to utilize the material from this week's lectures to assist in this goal. We have not completed but are near completing it. We plan on resubmitting our proposal tomorrow.
- Tasks Completed: Each member attended lecture and particiapted in group discussion about solving our problems, most notably in data storage. 
- Problems: We did not encounter any notable problems this week.
- Plans: We plan to resubmit the proposal by Monday and spend the rest of the week reading in the csv file into our chosen data structure. Depending on how smoothly that goes, we may try to get started on our traversal algorithm.
___
**Week 2**
---
- Goals: This week our goal was to submit the problem by Monday, prepare the CSV file, and work on the traversal if there was time. We did not reach this goal. Due to slow communication, the proposal still hasn't been approved. We did succeed in creating some basic code for preparing the graph.
- Tasks Completed: This week, we contacted our mentor to make sure our plans were ok with him. We rewrote and resubmitted the project proposal. We completed some basic code to prepare our graph in memory.
- Problems: There were no notable problems this week. In last week's plans, we forgot to account for the delay between submitting to our mentor and his response. Therefore, things took longer than we thought.
- Plans: This week, we will finish setting up the graph in memory and write the DFS traversal. We will also write some simple test cases.
___
**Week 3**
---
- Goals: Our goal this week was to load the graph into memory and write the DFS traversal. We exceeded this goal and were able to complete some tests cases for both the data reading and the traversal. We were even able to begin work on Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Tasks Completed: This week, we wrote the code to facilitate data cleaning and reading into memory and the code to make our traversal work. We also created some test graphs and wrote test cases to see how well the code works.
- Problems: We had two main problems this week. The first was with testing. We are having trouble setting the catch2 test software like is used in the MPs. However, we wrote our tests just as a normal executable instead. The second was when considering Dijkstra's algorithm. We cannot think how to update the distance values for things already in the priority queue.
- Plans: We plan to finish Dijksta's algorithm and the PageRank this week and hopefully a few test cases. This will allow us plenty of time to prepare the presentation and paper.
___
**Week 4**
---
- Goals: Our goal this week was to finish Dijkstra's Algorithm and PageRank and complete a few test cases, if possible. We surpassed this goal, finishing numerous rigorous test cases for both algorithms and making us confident in their utility.
- Tasks Completed: This week, the group finished coding around Thursday. the group was able to meet on Sunday to write test cases for each method.
- Problems: We did not encounter any significant problems this week. All of the issues that came up wile testing the algorithms were solved in a group meeting.
- Plans: We plan to finish testing on the full dataset this week and working on the presentation materials in order to be finished before finals week. This will also allow us time to correct any problems that appear.
___
**Week 5**
---
- Goals: Our goal this week was to finish the main function, the results file and the presentation. We did not reach this goal and only acheived the planning of the presentation and the results file. We also finished the main function.
- Tasks Completed: We wrote the results.md file and planned out what we would say for the presentation this week. We also finished the main function.
- Problems: We encountered no problems this week.
- Plans: We plan to finish the project completely this week. All that is left to do is proofread the results file and record our presentation.
___
**Week 6**
---
- Goals: Our goal this week was to finish the project. We achieved this goal.
- Tasks Completed: We finished all final materials including the written report, the final presentation, and the README. 
- Problems: We encountered no problems this week.
- Plans: The project is finished. No future plans.
